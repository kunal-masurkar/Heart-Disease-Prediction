# Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning-based web application to predict heart disease using a decision tree classifier.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for input
- Predicts heart disease based on medical parameters
- Uses a decision tree classifier for predictions
- Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and Python

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Flask, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Decision Tree Classifier)
- **Web Technologies** (HTML, CSS)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kunal-masurkar/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## How to Use
